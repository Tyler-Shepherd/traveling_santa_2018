# traveling_santa_2018
My solution to Kaggle's Traveling Santa 2018 - Prime Paths problem. https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths/data. Uses DBSCAN clustering to find clusters, computes the Traveling Salesman Problem over the clusters, then solves the TSP within each cluster. Some initial code taken from https://www.kaggle.com/theoviel/greedy-reindeer-starter-code.
